The mean of a dataset 𝑥 is mathematically expressed as $\\sum_i \\frac{x_i}{n}$, where $𝑖 = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$ . In other words, it’s the sum of all the elements 𝑥ᵢ divided by the number of items in the dataset $x$.\n",

If the number of elements 𝑛 of the dataset is odd, then the median is the value at the middle position: $0.5(n + 1)$. If $n$ is even, then the median is the arithmetic mean of the two values in the middle, that is, the items at the positions $0.5n$ and $0.5𝑛 + 1$.\n",

You can express the sample variance of the dataset $x$ with $n$ elements mathematically as $s^2 = \\sum_i \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$, where $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$ and $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean of $x$.

The standard deviation is often more convenient than the variance because it has the same unit as the data points. Once you get the variance, you can calculate the standard deviation with pure Python."
