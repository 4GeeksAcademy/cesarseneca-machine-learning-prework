## What you will be capable of doing

You are here because you want to become a Machine Learning expert, what a smart decision, I don't have to tell you already how AI is already shaping our world in ways that are impossible to explain.

Just as an example, here is a quick taste of what you will be capable to do after this course, some of these examples have been taken from projects developed by our graduates:
1. Diagnost neumonia by looking at x-rays with 90% accuracy (higher than doctors).
2. Find a childs in big crowds of more than 20k people.
3. Predict stock market prices with 70% accuracy (for specific scenarios).
4. Find guns in big crowds or buzy places like airports.

And this is just the top of the iceberg, maybe your final project, but the knowledge and fundamentals that you will adquire during the course you will be able basically and AI team in the world to help shape and develop today's most advanced Artificial Inteligences.

## Looking for jobs

As of today, our students are already working at companies like CEMEX, Blackstone, the City of Coral Gables (the most advanced city in the US in terms of AI) and many others.

You won't need any other course of training, all you will have to do is work hard to practice what you learned and be able to demonstrate during an interview the same skills you adquired during the course and your final project presentation.

## Methodology

At any 4Geek's course you will applied our teaching principles, this course is not exception:
1. Flipped classroom: Technical skills are only adquired thru practice, the class will be a lab, you will come to class with lessons already read, lot's of questions and ready to practice.
2. 

## Syllabus in a nutshell

In general terms, we will cover the following topics:
1. Coding in Python.
2. Working with the terminal.
3.
