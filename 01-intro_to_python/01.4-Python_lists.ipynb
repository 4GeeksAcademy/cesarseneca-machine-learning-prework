    "## What is a List?\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is, normally, any collection of values.  The rules of how to add or remove elements from that list can change from one programming language to another.  But – generally – they are the only ways for developers to create elements.\n",
    "Lists are not the only way we have to list store multiple values at once but it is the most used tool for that purpose. For example: list of students, list of artists, list of transactions…anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "This primitive data-type does a lot more stuff than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every list has the same basic concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The items:** are the actual values inside in each position of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The length:** is the size of the list (how many items the list has).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index:** is the position of the element.\n",

    "![what is an list define list](./assets/this-is-an-array.png)\n",

Trying to get the 2nd position will return \"undefined\" because it will mean that we are trying to access the third element (which does not exist).  For example, to get any items in the list you can do the following:"
